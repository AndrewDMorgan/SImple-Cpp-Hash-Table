# Simple-Cpp-Hash-Table
A bad hash table written in c++.

Currently it has a simple hash that takes the first two letters of a word and the last two letters. Because of this, you're keys have to be at least 2 characters. It also doesn't do anything to stop collisions. I found that it's preforance is a bit faster the the std::unordered_map, although it also is much simpler.
